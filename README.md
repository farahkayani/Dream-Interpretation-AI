# Dream-Interpretation-AI
This project builds a Dream Interpretation AI using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LoRA fine-tuning to deliver accurate, context-aware interpretations. FAISS-based retrieval provides relevant dream cases as context for a TinyLlama model fine-tuned on a dream corpus, enabling efficient, culturally aware, and personalized analyses.
